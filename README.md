# DummiBot-V3

## Description

DummiBot is an RPG based bot within Discord. DummiBot has seen many different versions off bots, it started out as a project to kill time with, but it became bigger...
I originally gave up on it until a few of my friends started asking me why it wasn't online much. So I picked up where I left off, a bot with some fun commands (about 5) and turned it into a utility bot... it had easy and handy commands to get information of certain things within Discord. But I wanted to have some interaction with the bot so I started making any command I could come up with. And then I ended up making it a game... not the one you know now, but the "BETA" of the DummiBot you now have...

## Subclasses

**Disclaimer**: this is totally _**NOT**_ inspired by Destiny at all!

### Warlock

#### Description

Warlocks have been amongst us since the beginning of time, they have been studying time and space for many years. They have been faced to be called witches, devil messengers, users of black magic. Nobody really knows what they do and how they do it. They are not very open to the outside world. To make it easy to explain, they use magic. Their health, attack and defense don't really stand out, but their stamina does, they found a way to change their stamina into mana, this gives them power. Not only that, with this power they have the ability to fore see the future, and know it's opponents exact movement and whereabouts. This makes their dodge and stealth very good. Their weak damage gets made up with magic powers and critical damage. Their knowledge about time and space, allow them to store items in other dimensions.

### Hunter

#### Description

Hunters have been amongst us since the beginnings of societies. They were often called thieves. Their skills in speed and agility made it easy for them to steal food and gear from passing creatures. Their lack of social skill show them always to be lonely, they also can't really survive in wellness, they barely come round with the stuff they steal. This shows in their health and storage. Their stamina however is high just like its dodge and stealth, this is to steal items from creatures. Due to all this weakness, its attack, defense and critical is higher tha, average, but nothing to be proud of.

### Sniper

#### Description

Snipers are the 21st century's invention. They haven't been around for very long, but they do have a lot knowledge in finding the right spot. They use their weapon for long range advantages. This makes their stealth stand out the most. With this they also get a lot of storage space. There is 1 really big downside of being a sniper, they are easily tracked. Due to them being in 1 spot a lot, they have trained their dodge senses to hear everything around them. Their stamina is low because of their stationary position. Their damage and attack don't stand out, but their critical damage is high due to the range they shoot from.

### Tank

#### Description

Tanks are literal human tanks. Don't think they look human, they're build with a different DNA. They have high health, high melee power. The power they posses allows them to have a lot of armor and storage space on them. This however slows them down and tires them really quickly. Their size also makes them a very big target, you can barely miss it, neither can it be stealthy. It's size however makes up to it's reach. It's critical damage can result in collateral damage.

| dodge    | 1%     |
| stealth  | 1%     |
| critical | 10%    |
| storage  | 1000   |

### Warrior

#### Description

Warriors are tanks, but trained to be at the frontline. Compared to tanks they are weaker but faster, they have high damage, high health. Their significantly smaller size also gives them the advantage in stamina. They wear a decent bit of armor, making their defense high. They also have a lot of battle experience, their dodge rates are incredible. Their lack in storage however is noticeable. Their way of being brute, is noticeable in collision damage critical hits.
